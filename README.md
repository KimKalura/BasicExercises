# Basic Exercises

This repository includes algorithms with java statements: conditionals (if-else, switch), loops (for, while).

## Features

Algorithms directly return an answer or read the input from the console.

They include:
- average of consecutive numbers from x to y
- checking a prime number
- sum of numbers
- calculating the highest and lowest price from a list of prices
- a program that prints the product of 2 consecutive numbers from the array
- smallest number of any 3 numbers
- method that returns whether a number is even or not
- program to check whether a word is a palindrome
- program to count letters, spaces, numbers, and other characters in a String
- validating that the password chosen by the user is written correctly
- factorial of a number
- first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
- implementation of a "guessing game"
- program in which the user enters numbers from the keyboard one by one, until he enters the value 0, at which point the average of all entered numbers will be displayed on the console
